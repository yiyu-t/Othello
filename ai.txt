* I wrote a “smart_ai” method in my game_controller. 
    Whenever it’s the AI’s turn, “ai_make_move” will call “smart_ai”.
    "Smart_ai" is a greedy method that choose the step that will flip most disks.
* The AI player becomes smarter. Before I just let the AI randomly choose from
    legal moves, and it was very easy to beat the computer.
* If I don’t have the “smart_ai” method, most players won. 
    After I have it, few people won. 
* Even though the AI became smarter, it’s still possible to beat it. 
    Especially when I aim for the corners and the edges, the AI tends to fail.
* A better AI should give different weights to different locations on the 
    board: the corner and edges should have higher weights than other 
    locations on board. I would definitely implement this feature for my AI in
    the future.
* An ideal AI would be able to predict multiple steps instead of just one. 
    It should have the following functions:
    * Take into consideration the weights of different locations;
    * Be able to calculate for all the steps for every whole round of game.
